# MacroSummary Trading Strategies Backtest Repository

Welcome to the official GitHub repository for trading strategy backtests by the author of the "MacroSummary" blog. This repository showcases a comprehensive collection of trading strategies, meticulously backtested to demonstrate their effectiveness and potential in various market conditions. My goal is to provide a transparent and accessible resource for anyone interested in quantitative financial research, trading strategy development, and portfolio management. And to see what does not work.

## Repository Structure
Each trading strategy within this repository is organized into its own dedicated folder. These folders contain not only the source code used to perform the backtests but also detailed results analyzed in separate files. This structure is designed to make navigation intuitive and ensure that users can easily find both the strategies and their outcomes.

## Folder Contents
    - Source Code: The Python used to execute the backtests.
    - Backtest Frameworks: Can be various, from backtrader to quantconnect.
    - Results Analysis: A comprehensive analysis of the backtest results, including performance metrics, risk assessments, and graphical representations.

Trading involves significant risk of financial loss and is not suitable for every investor.
